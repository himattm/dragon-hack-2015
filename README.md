I have always been an avid animal lover and my partner and I have been following the recent trends in wearable tech. We started thinking of all of the great things that advancements in wearable technology have been able to provide people and we wanted to expand this to pets. Especially pets with impairments such has deafness. We developed the idea for a collar that could respond to voice activation and provide the dog with a tactile response via vibration. The dog can then be trained to sit, stay, come, rollover, etc all to voice commands despite being unable to hear well! This will enable pets and their humans to communicate in a much more straightforward and hands free way.
